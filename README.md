This repository contains the code written and used for the TreeFormers paper.

**data_loaders** - various scripts used to load, modify, and format data for training transformers.

**lr_baseline** - interactive python notebook containing code written to establish a logistic regression baseline, based on research from online and course materials.

**pre_trained_transformers** - contains engine code used to train and test pre-trained, fine tuned vision transformers.

**scratch_transformer** - contains code adapted from Meta Platforms that was done in an attempt to train ViT from scratch.
